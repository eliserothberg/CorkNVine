          <ul id="wineTypes">
            
            <p><h5>Whites</h5></p>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Chardonnay</strong>-   shar-duh-NAY - has a medium to light body with noticeable acidity and flavors of green plum, apple, and pear. In warmer locations the flavors become more citrus, peach, and melon, while in very warm locations more fig and tropical fruit notes such as banana and mango come out.</p>

            <p><strong>Riesling</strong>-   REES-ling - is a crisp, clean wine with green apple, pear and lime flavors. The best offer pleasing mineral qualities as well. With age, Riesling takes on honey flavors and attractive oily aromas.</p>

            <p><strong>Sauvignon blanc</strong>-   so-vee-nyon blahn - has noticeable acidity and "green flavors" of grass or green bell peppers with some tropical fruit and floral notes in cooler climates. In warmer climates, it can develop more tropical fruit notes.</p>
          </li>

          <p><h5>Reds</h5></p>

          <li>

            <p><strong>Cabernet Sauvignon</strong>-   kab-ur-nay so-vee-nyon - has blackcurrant notes that can be accompanied by green bell pepper notes, mint and cedar in cool climates which will all become more pronounced as the wine ages. In more moderate climates the blackcurrant notes are often seen with black cherry and black olives notes.</p>

            <p><strong>Merlot</strong>-   mair-LO - is a soft, supple wine with nice fruit flavors of plums and blackberries and occasionally mint, chocolate and eucalyptus flavors and aromas. Typically, it is ready to drink earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon, which sometimes needs a few years for its astringent tannins to mellow. Outside of Europe, New World Merlot shines in places like California, Chile and Washington State.</p>

            <p><strong>Pinot Noir</strong>-   PEE-no nwahr -  wines tend to have red fruit aromas of cherries, raspberries and strawberries when young. As the wines age, Pinots have the potential to develop earthy aromas that can contribute to the complexity of the wine.</p>

            <p><strong>Syrah</strong>-   see-RAH - has a style and flavor profile that is influenced by the climate where the grapes are grown, with moderate climates tending to produce medium to full-bodied wines with medium-plus to high levels of tannins and flavors of blackberry, mint and black pepper notes. In hot climates Syrah is more consistently full-bodied with softer tannin, jammier fruit and spice notes of liquorice, anise and earthy leather.</p>

            <p><strong>Zinfandel</strong>-   zin-fan-dell - grapes typically produce a robust red wine, although in the United States a semi-sweet ros√© (blush-style) wine called White Zinfandel has six times as many sales as the red wine. The grape's high sugar content can be fermented into levels of alcohol exceeding 15 percent. The taste of the red wine depends on the ripeness of the grapes from which it is made. Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate in wines from cooler areas, whereas blackberry, anise and pepper notes are more common in wines made in warmer areas.</p>
