            <ul class="list-group">
              <li class="list-group-item">In an experiment, it was found that wine drinkers paid more for wines with hard to pronounce names. It is particularly interesting to note that participants who knew more about wine were more likely to report that difficult-to-pronounce wines were worth more money. –
            </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">In 2001, a panel of wine experts gave one of the lowest possible scores to an average-priced Bordeaux that was served in a cheap bottle. When it was served in an expensive bottle, it received one of the highest possible scores.
            </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">A $6 bottle of wine sold at Walmart has been ranked as one of the best in the world by Decanter Magazine, which covers wine and spirits. The award-winning red wine is La Moneda Reserva's Malbec, a Chilean wine whose description notes that it has a "deep purple color with violet tints, rounded and velvety tannins, complex plum, fig, and strawberry flavors and excellent length."
            </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">In 1976, there was a wine tasting in Paris that blindly compared Californian wines to French wines. California won and the lone reporter covering the event was blacklisted for reporting it.

              <li class="list-group-item">In an experiment conducted in 2001 at the University of Bordeaux, every one of the 54 undergraduates in wine making and tasting thought they were tasting a red wine while it was actually a dyed white wine. Furthermore, when comparing identical wine of different prices, experts raved about the expensive wine while panning the cheap wine </li>

            <ul class="list-group">
              <li class="list-group-item">The wine cork is not for smelling. The cork is actually for examining. If you have the good fortune to sit down in a restaurant with a wine steward, you're not going to make a great impression by sniffing the cork when he hands it to you. Check to see if it's all in one piece; a fragmented or moldy cork might mean a lower quality wine. With the best wines, the cork will display the date and other information, as well.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">The dent in the bottom of a wine bottle is called the punt or kick.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Wine glasses should always be held by the stem, so as not to overly heat the wine with your hand.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><span>"Wine legs”</span> don't actually determine quality, but only determines that the wine has a high content of alcohol. If you cover your glass the legs will disappear. The phenomenon called <span>tears of wine,</span><span> curtains,</span> or <span> church windows</span> is manifested as a ring of clear liquid, near the top of a glass of wine, from which droplets continuously form and drop back into the wine.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Dryness has a couple of meanings in wine. The term is commonly used to refer to the absence of sweetness, and most table wines wines are technically dry in that they lack the residual sugar that makes dessert wines sweet. The typical Merlot has the same amount of residual sugar as the typical Cabernet—virtually none.
              </li>
               <li class="list-group-item">Women get drunker than men. This is because women have less of an enzyme in the stomach to metabolize wine. Men have more of an enzyme that degrades alcohol, and, in general, men can safely consume twice the amount of alcohol as women because of this and other metabolic differences.
